# Project 1: Building and Securing a Small Network

## *Overview*
This project involves designing, configuring, and securing a small network using Cisco devices. The project is divided into four weeks, each focusing on a specific aspect of network implementation and security.

## *Project Timeline and Deliverables*

### *Week 1: Network Design and Configuration*
- *Task:* Design a small network topology, define the IP addressing scheme, and configure Cisco devices.
- *Deliverables:*
  - Network design diagram.
  - IP addressing table.
  - Initial configuration scripts for routers and switches.

### *Week 2: VLANs and Inter-VLAN Routing*
- *Task:* Implement VLANs and configure VLAN trunks and Inter-VLAN routing using the Router-on-a-Stick method.
- *Deliverables:*
  - VLAN configuration scripts.
  - Inter-VLAN routing setup documentation.
  - VLAN troubleshooting report.

### *Week 3: Network Security Implementation*
- *Task:* Implement security features including port security, ACLs, and basic firewall rules on switches and routers.
- *Deliverables:*
  - Security configuration scripts.
  - Security policy document.
  - Report on security implementation and effectiveness.

### *Week 4: Final Testing and Reporting*
- *Task:* Test network functionality, security, and connectivity. Prepare a final report and presentation.
- *Deliverables:*
  - Final report.
  - Presentation slides.
  - Test results and network assessment.

## *Network Implementation Details*

### *1. Network Topology*
- *Devices Used:* Cisco routers, switches, PCs.
- *Network Type:* Small office/home office (SOHO).
- *IP Addressing:* Subnetted IPv4 scheme based on company requirements.

### *2. VLAN Configuration*
- *VLANs:* Different VLANs for departments (e.g., Admin, IT, Sales).
- *Inter-VLAN Routing:* Configured using a *Router-on-a-Stick* method.
- *Trunking:* VLAN trunks configured between switches and routers.

### *3. Security Implementation*
- *Port Security:* Restrict unauthorized access on switch ports.
- *Access Control Lists (ACLs):* Restrict network traffic based on policies.
- *Basic Firewall Rules:* Implemented on routers for external protection.

### *4. Network Testing & Validation*
- *Connectivity Testing:* Ping, traceroute, and network monitoring.
- *Security Assessment:* Verify ACLs, port security, and firewall rules.
- *Performance Testing:* Measure latency, packet loss, and throughput.
